This repository contains transistor-level designs and simulations of various flip-flop architectures—Master-Slave Flip-Flop (MSFF), Hybrid Latch Flip-Flop (HLFF), and Sense-Amplifier-Based Flip-Flop (SAFF)—implemented using NGSpice. 
Each circuit is optimized for low power and high-speed operation, with performance evaluated through Energy-Delay Product (EDP) analysis. 
The repository includes NGSpice .sp files, supporting model files, output waveforms, and detailed documentation in the form of PDFs. 
These designs are suitable for energy-efficient sequential elements in VLSI systems and serve as a strong reference for students working on advanced CMOS flip-flop implementations.
